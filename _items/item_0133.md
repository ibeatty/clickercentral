A small ball is released from rest at position A and rolls down a
vertical circular track under the influence of gravity.

![Item133_fig1.gif](../images/Item133_fig1.gif) When
the ball reaches position B, which of the indicated directions most
nearly corresponds to the direction of the ball's acceleration?

Enter (9) if the direction cannot be determined.

###Answer 

(2) At position B the acceleration has a tangential component and
a radial component. Both components can be determined at position B.
Worked out carefully one gets 18 degrees above position #2. It is common
for students to neglect one component or the other.
