###Answer 

(6) This problem is intended to elicit a vigorous discussion of
work. Students have a difficult time reconciling the formal definition
of work with the colloquial one. Every one of the answers is defensible
depending upon one's perspective. Lifting a heavy box requires doing
work against gravity. Putting it down actually requires that you do the
same amount of work. Gravity does no net work, but humans are not
conservative systems. Depending upon the surface it may be more
advantageous to push the box.
