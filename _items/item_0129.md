![Item129_fig1.gif](../images/Item129_fig1.gif){: .image-right } A uniform volume distribution of
charge has radius R and total charge Q.  A point charge -q is released
from rest at point b, which is a distance 3R from the center of the
distribution. When the point charge reaches a, which of the following is
true regarding the potential energy, U?

1. U<sub>a</sub> = -U<sub>b</sub>
2. U<sub>a</sub> = -2U<sub>b</sub>/3
3. U<sub>a</sub> = -3U<sub>b</sub>/2
4. U<sub>a</sub> = -9U<sub>b</sub>/4
5. U<sub>a</sub> = U<sub>b</sub>
6. U<sub>a</sub> = 2U<sub>b</sub>/3
7. U<sub>a</sub> = 3U<sub>b</sub>/2
8. U<sub>a</sub> = 9U<sub>b</sub>/4
9. None of the above
10. Cannot be determined

###Answer 

(7) Many students use an inverse square dependence appropriate
for fields. Others will take the field at b and multiply by the
displacement. Still others will assert that the potential doubles
because they are using the distance to the surface of the sphere.
