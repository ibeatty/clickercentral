## The question for students:

Below is shown a strobe diagram indicating the position of four objects
at successive time intervals.  The objects move from left to right.

![Item033_fig1.gif](../images/Item033_fig1.gif)

During the intervals shown, which of the objects experience no net force
in the horizontal direction?

1. Object A only
2. Object B only
3. Object C only
4. Object D only
5. Objects A and B
6. Objects B and C
7. Objects A and C
8. None of the above
9. Cannot be determined


<hr/>

## Commentary for teachers:

### Answer

(8); Objects with no net horizontal force will move with constant velocity. The objects moving with constant velocity are B and D. This question helps to reinforce the idea that it is change in motion, not motion itself, that requires a force.
