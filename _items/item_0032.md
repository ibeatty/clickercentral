### Answer

(4); on the horizontal partion there is no net force, and therefore no F<sub>y</sub>. On the slope the net force in the y direction is due to gravity and a component of the normal force.  Alternatively, since the ball accelerates along the slope, the net force must be parallel to the slope and have a component in the vertical direction.
