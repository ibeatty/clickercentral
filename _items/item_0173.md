Which situation has the least (magnitude) angular momentum about the
origin?

<ol type="A"> <li>A 2 kg mass travels along the line y = 3m with speed
1.5 m/s.</li> <li>A 1 kg mass travels in a circle of r = 4.5 m about the
origin with speed 2 m/s.</li> <li>A disk with I = 3 kg-m<sup>2</sup>
rotates about its center (on origin) with &omega; = 3 rad/s.</li> </ol>

1. A
2. B
3. C
4. Both A and B
5. Both A and C
6. Both B and C
7. All have the same magnitude angular momentum

###Answer

(7) Students frequently think that objects traveling in a straight line
have no angular momentum. An interesting follow up question is to ask
how students would answer if the disk in situation were rotating about
the point (1,0).
