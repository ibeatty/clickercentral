![Item208_fig1.gif](../images/Item208_fig1.gif){: .image-with-caption } Where,
other than at infinity, is the electric field 0 in the vicinity of the
dipole shown?

1. Along the y-axis.
2. At the origin.
3. At two points, one to the right of (a, 0), the other to the left of (-a,
   0).
4. At two points on the y-axis, one below the origin, one above the origin.
5. None of the above.

###Answer

(5) Students have a lot of difficulty distinguishing electric field from
potential. Students already exposed to the concept of potential
frequently respond that the field is zero along the y-axis. If there are
many confused students, before identifying the correct response, it
helps to have the students draw the field lines.
