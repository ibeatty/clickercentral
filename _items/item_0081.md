A bug walks on a rotating disk.  Given: M<sub>bug</sub>,
I<sub>disk</sub>, R<sub>disk</sub>, and &omega;<sub>o</sub> when the bug
is at r<sub>1</sub>. The bug crawls to r<sub>2</sub>.  Find
&omega;<sub>final</sub> for the system.

What principle would you use to solve the problem MOST EFFICIENTLY?

1. Kinematics only
2. F = ma or Newton's laws
3. Work-Energy theorem
4. Impulse-Momentum theorem
5. Angular Impulse-Angular Momentum theorem
6. Not enough information given


<hr/>

### Answer

(5) This problem helps students develop a principle-based approach to
problems. Many students may think correctly that this is a conservation
of angular momentum problem and not recognize that the general principle
is the angular impulse - angular momentum theorem.
