A hoop of mass 4 kg and radius r rolls
without slipping down an incline 30&deg; to the horizontal.  The hoop is
released from rest.  What is the speed of the hoop after its center has
fallen a distance h?

1. (4g(h-r))<sup>1/2</sup>
2. (2gh)<sup>1/2</sup>
3. (gh)<sup>1/2</sup>
4. (0.5g(h+r))<sup>1/2</sup>
5. none of the above
6. cannot be determined

<hr/>

### Answer

(3.) Students should realize that the speed cannot depend upon the
radius.  Answer #2 is the speed that a falling point mass would have and
the hoop must have less than that.
