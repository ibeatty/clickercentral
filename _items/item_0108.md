## The question for students:

A flywheel rotating about an axis through its center starts from rest,
rotates with constant angular acceleration for 2 seconds while making
one complete revolution and thereafter maintains constant angular
velocity. How long does it take the wheel to make a total of 6 full
revolutions?

1. 4 secs
2. 5 secs
3. 6 secs
4. 7 secs
5. 9 secs
6. None of above
7. Cannot be determined

<hr/>

## Commentary for teachers:

### Answer

(4) This problem provides an excellent opportunity to discuss the power
of graphs for problem solving. Making a sketch of angular velocity vs.
time provides the easiest way to answer the problem. Conversely, an
algebraic solution is complicated.
