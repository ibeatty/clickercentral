A bug sits on a disk at a point 0.5 m from the center.  If the
coefficient of friction between the bug and disk is 0.8, the maximum
angular velocity the disk can have before the bug slips off the disk is
most nearly:

1. 2 rad/s
2. 4 rad/s
3. 5.2 rad/s
4. 16 rad/s
5. None of the above
6. Cannot be determined

### Answer

(2) Some students may respond (6) thinking that the mass of the bug is
needed for solution.
