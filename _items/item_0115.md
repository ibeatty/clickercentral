Two moles of an ideal gas fill a volume of 10 liters with a pressure of
2.4 atm.  The gas is thermally insulated from the surroundings.  A
membrane is broken which allows the gas to expand into the new volume
which is 3 times as large as the old volume.  The new temperature is ...

1. The same as before.
2. Lower than before.
3. Higher than before.
4. Cannot be determined.

### Answer

(1) Students may erroneously apply prior knowledge that gas cools as it
expands. Some will likely think that the answer cannot be determined
without more information.
