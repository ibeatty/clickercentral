![Item142_fig1.gif](../images/Item142_fig1.gif) Two
blocks, M<sub>2</sub> = M<sub>1</sub> but of different sizes, having the
same speed, move from a frictionless surface onto a surface having
friction coefficient &mu;<sub>k</sub>.

Which stops in the shorter time?

1. M<sub>1</sub>
2. M<sub>2</sub>
3. Both stop in the same time
4. Cannot be determined



<hr/>

###Answer 

(3) Both blocks will experience the same acceleration. If they
have the same initial velocity, they will stop in the same time.
