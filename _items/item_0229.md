The diagram shows a circular wire loop of radius R carrying current I. 
What is the direction of the magnetic field, B, at the center of the
loop?

###Answer

(3) This is the best response given the choices. The question poses
little difficulty for students who have learned about the magnetic field
of current loops as a magnetic dipole. For these students this question
just confirms their knowledge. For students who are trying to apply the
Biot-Savart law to the loop as a set of current elements the question is
more challenging.
