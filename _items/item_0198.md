## The question for students:

In a region of space there is a uniform magnetic field pointing in the
positive z direction.  In what direction should a negative charge move
to experience a force in the positive x direction?

1. In the positive z direction
2. In the negative z direction
3. In the positive x direction
4. In the negative x direction
5. In the positive y direction
6. In the negative y direction
7. It can move in any direction
8. The force cannot be in the +x direction
