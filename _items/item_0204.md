description: Identify the induced charge on the surface of a cavity in a conductor.
goal: Hone the concept of a conductor
source: 283-225, Charge induced in a neutral conductor
keywords: Electric Field, Electromagnetism, Induced Charge

A positive charge +Q is placed outside a neutral conductor.  Inside the
conductor is a cavity containing no charge.  What is the net charge on
the surface bounding the cavity? <div class="img-center"><img
src="/files/Item204_fig1.gif" /></div>

1. A positive charge +Q
2. A positive charge +q < +Q
3. Zero charge
4. A negative charge |-q| < |+Q|
5. A negative charge -Q
6. Cannot determine the charge.

### Answer

(3) Students have difficulty envisioning induced charge distributions,
especially when the conductor has an irregular shape.
