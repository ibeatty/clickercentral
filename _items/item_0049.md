A monkey hangs on a rope.  What forces act on the monkey?  (Ignore
forces due to the air.)

1. Friction, Gravitation 
2. Tension, Gravitation 
3. Friction, Tension, Gravitation 
4. Normal, Friction, Gravitation 
5. More than one answer is true 
6. None of the above 
7. Cannot be determined

### Answer

(1); Assuming the monkey hangs from a vertical rope
the only forces can be gravity and friction.  Students should realize
that there is only one action-at-a-distance force in this case, that of
gravity, and that there must be some contact force(s) to balance that.
