## The question for students:

A mass of 0.5 kg moving along a horizontal frictionless surface
encounters a spring having k = 200 N/m.  The mass compresses the spring
by 0.1 meters before reversing its direction.  Consider the total time
the mass is in contact with the spring.  What is the total impulse
delivered to the mass by the spring?
<br><br> Which of the following principles or combination of principles
could be used to solve this problem MOST EFFICIENTLY.

1. Newton's 2nd law & dynamics
2. Work-Energy theorem
3. Impulse-Momentum theorem
4. 1 and 2
5. 1 and 3
6. 2 and 3
7. Other

## Commentary for teachers:

### Answer 

(6) This is a two-principle problem. Again, student response is
not as important as discussing what clues there are for deciding what
principles are needed.
