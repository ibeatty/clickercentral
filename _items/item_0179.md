around wires carrying currents.  Consider a long thin straight wire with
a current I.  Which of the following statements about the magnetic field
lines is true?

<blockquote> <ol type="A"> <li>Field lines are parallel to the
wire.</li> <li>Field lines are perpendicular to the wire.</li> <li>Field
lines are directed radially away from the wire.</li> <li>Field lines are
circles centered on any point on the wire.</li> </ol> </blockquote>

1. A only

3. C only
4. D only
5. A and C only
