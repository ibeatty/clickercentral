A charged particle moves into a region containing both an electric and
magnetic field.  Which of the statements below are true?

<blockquote> <ol type="A"> <li>The particle cannot accelerate in the
direction of B.</li> <li>The path of the particle must be a circle.</li>
<li>Any change in the particle's kinetic energy is caused by the E
field.</li> </ol> </blockquote>

1. Only A
2. Only B
3. Only C
4. Both A&B
5. Both A&C
6. Both B&C
7. All are true.
8. None are true.

###Answer

(3) The only cases that most students see is the one having E and B
perpendicular. As a result they discount the case of E and B parallel
and think statement A is also true.
