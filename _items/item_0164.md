You are given this problem:

<blockquote>

![Item164_fig1.gif](../images/Item164_fig1.gif){: .image-right } A
block sits on an incline <i>with</i> friction. Given the height of the
block, the angle of incline, the coefficient of kinetic friction, and
that block starts from rest, find the speed at the bottom of the
incline.

</blockquote>

What principle(s) would you use to solve the problem MOST EFFICIENTLY?

1. Kinematics only
2. F = ma or Newton's laws
3. Work-Energy theorem
4. Impulse-Momentum theorem
5. Angular Impulse-Angular Momentum
6. 1 & 2
7. 1 & 3
8. 2 & 3
9. none of the above
10. Not enough information given


<hr/>

### Answer 

(3) The velocity can be determined using kinematics, but the 2nd
law is also needed, i.e. #6.
