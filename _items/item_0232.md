description: Identify the correct assertion regarding the field due to a current segment.
goal: Reason regarding the Biot-Savart law
source: 283-650 B from an infinite wire.
keywords: Electromagnetism, Magnetic Field

If B = &mu;<sub>0</sub>I/4&pi;D at point P which is a distance D from
the end of a "half-infinite" wire, then what would be the magnetic field
at P if the wire went to infinity in both directions?

1. It would be 0 because the left-portion of the wire would cancel the
   magnetic field from the right-portion of the wire.
2. It would be twice the answer above.

3. It is not 0, but it is also not twice the answer above - you have some
   cancellation and you need to figure it out putting in the appropriate
   sines and cosines.

###Answer

(2) This question is only of value if one has obtained the field at the
end of a semi-infinite wire by direct integration. It is important for
students to recognize situations where the Biot-Savart Law must be used
versus cases where Ampere's Law can be used.
