description: Indicate the truth or falsity of a statement regarding the relationship between the electric field and potential at a point.
goal: Hone the relationship between E and V
source: 283-475 Must V=0 if E=0?
keywords: Electric Field, Electromagnetism, Potentials

True or false: it is possible to have the electric field be 0 at some
point in space and the electric potential be non-zero at that same
point.

1. True
2. False

### Answer

(1) Whichever answer students give, ask them to draw a charge
configuration which satisfies their answer. Often this is sufficient to
cause them to change their mind. If appropriate raise for discussion the
case of the interior of a uniformly charged spherical shell.
