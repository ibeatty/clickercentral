Andy has the following series of displacements: 3 m to the right; 4 m to
the left; 5 m to the right; and 2 m to the left.  What is his distance
traveled?

1. 0
2. 2 m
3. 2 m (to the right)
4. 2 m (to the left)
5. 14 m (to the right)
6. 8 m (to the right)
7. Impossible to determine
8. None of the above

### Answer 

(8) Students just learning about vectors and displacements are
inclined to over specify quantities. Before they knew anything about
vectors they used distance as a scalar but can become confused and give
it the direction of the total displacement.
