Two blocks with mass m<sub>2</sub> > m<sub>1</sub> sit on a horizontal
surface having friction. Both blocks are pulled with a constant speed,
but v<sub>2</sub> < v<sub>1</sub>, by a rope under tension.  Which
tension does the most work moving the block a distance D along the
surface?

1. T<sub>1</sub>
2. T<sub>2</sub>
3. Both do the same work.
4. Cannot be determined.
