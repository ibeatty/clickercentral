## The question for students:

Desert mirages are inverted images.  From this, what can we conclude
about the index of refraction of hot air compared to cold air?

1. n<sub>HOT AIR</sub> > n<sub>COLD AIR</sub>
2. n<sub>HOT AIR</sub> + n<sub>COLD AIR</sub>
3. n<sub>HOT AIR</sub> < n<sub>COLD AIR</sub>
4. Mirages have nothing to do with refraction
