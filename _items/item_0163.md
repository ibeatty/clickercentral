You are given this problem:

<blockquote>

![Item163_fig1.gif](../images/Item163_fig1.gif){: .image-right } A
block sits on a frictionless incline. Given the angle of incline, the
distance along incline, and the mass of block, find the acceleration
after traveling a distance d.

</blockquote>

What principle would you use to solve the problem MOST EFFICIENTLY?

1. Kinematics only
2. F = ma or Newton's laws
3. Work-Energy theorem
4. Impulse-Momentum theorem
5. Angular Impulse-Ang. Momentum
6. More than one of the above
7. Not enough information given


<hr/>

###Answer 

(2) The 2nd law is needed to find the acceleration. Students who
answer that only kinematics is needed are relying on memory.
