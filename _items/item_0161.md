## The question for students:

Ann is running with a constant speed of 3 m/s on a straight track.  Deb
is also running with constant speed but is initially 10 m behind Ann. If
Deb catches up to Ann after Deb has traveled 55 m, how fast is Deb
running?

1. 3.2 m/s
2. 3.55 m/s
3. 3.75 m/s
4. 4.15 m/s
5. More than 4.2 m/s
6. none of the above
7. cannot be determined



<hr/>

## Commentary for teachers:

### Answer 

(6) The correct speed is 3.67 m/s. Students indicating #2 or #3
are likely making an arithmetic error. Have students graph the position
vs. time graphs for each runner.
