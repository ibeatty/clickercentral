## The question for students:

<div class="img-right"><img
src="/files/Item256_fig1.gif" /></div>Four charges are positioned as
shown.  What is the direction of the electrical field at the origin?

1. Along i or in the +x direction
2. Along -i or in the -x direction
3. Along j or in the +y direction
4. Along -j or in the -y direction
5. Along some other direction
6. E=0 at the origin

## Commentary for teachers:

### Answer

(6) Difficulty with this question usually indicates that students are
not familiar with vectors. Good follow up question: ask whether it
matters if the charges are along a 45 degree line.
