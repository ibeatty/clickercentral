![Item262_fig1.gif](../images/Item262_fig1.gif){: .image-right } A cart
of mass m is moving with speed v. Is it possible for the kinetic energy
or the momentum to be larger after a collision?

1. No; it is impossible 
2. Yes; the kinetic energy can be larger 
3. Yes; the momentum can be larger 
4. Yes; both can be larger

###Answer

(4) Many students get fixated on the idea that all collisions are head
on and cause the object to lose energy and momentum.
