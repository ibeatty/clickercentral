A very long wire lies in a plane with a short wire segment.  The long
wire carries current I, while the short wire of length L carries current
i.  The two wires are parallel to each other. Which of the following
statements are true?

![Item234_fig1.gif](../images/Item234_fig1.gif)

<blockquote><ol type="A"> <li>The direction of the magnetic force
exerted by the long wire on the short wire is directed away from the
long wire.</li> <li>The magnitude of the force on the short wire is
&mu;<sub>0</sub>IiL/2&pi;d.</li> <li>The long wire experiences a force
of exactly the same magnitude as the force  experienced by the short
wire.</li> </ol></blockquote>

1. A only
2. B only
3. C only
4. A and B
5. A and C
6. B and C
7. A, B, and C
8. None of them are true

###Answer

(6) The force is attractive between the wires so statement A is false.
Students need to interpret the phrase 'very long' as implying that the
wire is infinite.
