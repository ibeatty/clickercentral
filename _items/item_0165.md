## The question for students:

You are given this problem:

<blockquote>

![Item165_fig1.gif](../images/Item165_fig1.gif){: .image-right } A
block sits on a frictionless incline. Given the angle of incline, the
distance along the incline, and that the block is initially at rest,
find the speed after traveling a distance d.

</blockquote>

What principle would you use to solve the problem MOST EFFICIENTLY?

1. Kinematics only
2. F = ma or Newton's laws
3. Work-Energy theorem
4. Impulse-Momentum theorem
5. Angular Impulse-Angular Momentum
6. 1 and 2
7. 1 and 3
8. 2 and 3
9. None of the above
10. Not enough information given

## Commentary for teachers:

### Answer 

(3) The change in gravitational potential can be found directly.
Alternately, the work done by the gravitational force must be equal to
the change in kinetic energy.
