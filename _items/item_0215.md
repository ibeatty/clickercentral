name: A2L Item 215
description: Indicate the truth or falsity of a statement regarding the implication of flux for the electric field on a surface.
goal: Relate flux and electric field
source: 283-405 If phi = 0, is E=0?
tags: ['electric-field', 'electromagnetism', 'flux']
keywords: Electric Field, Electromagnetism, Flux

## The question for students:

True or False:  If the electric flux = 0 over some closed Gaussian
surface, then this means that the electric field = 0 on that surface.

1. True
2. False


<hr/>

## Commentary for teachers:

### Answer

(2) A good followup question is; Even though the electric field is not
zero everywhere, can it be zero somewhere on the Gaussian surface? If
so, draw a charge configuration for which this is true?
