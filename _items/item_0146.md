## The question for students:

<div class="img-rightr"><img src="/files/Item146_fig1.gif" /></div> The
potential energy function for a certain body is shown at right.  If the
body is released from rest at a location corresponding to  point 4, the
object  would ...

1. move towards larger values of x.
2. move towards smaller values of x.
3. remain stationary.
4. oscillate back and forth.
5. None of the above
6. Cannot be determined


<hr/>

## Commentary for teachers:

### Answer 

(2) At position 4 the object experiences a force toward the
origin given by the negative of the slope of the potential curve.
Frequently students interpret the fact that U is zero at point 4 to mean
that there is no force.
