You are given this problem:

<blockquote>

![Item166_fig1.gif](../images/Item166_fig1.gif){: .image-right } A
block sits on a frictionless incline. Given the mass of the block, the
angle of incline, the distances d<sub>1</sub> and d<sub>2</sub>, and
that the block starts from rest, find the time to travel from
d<sub>1</sub> to d<sub>2</sub>.

</blockquote>

What principle would you use to solve the problem MOST EFFICIENTLY?

1. Kinematics only
2. F = ma or Newton's laws
3. Work-Energy theorem
4. Impulse-Momentum theorem
5. Angular Impulse-Angular Momentum
6. 1 & 2
7. 1 & 3
8. 2 & 3
9. None of the above
10. Not enough information given

### Answer 

(6) Students responding #1 are relying on memory and would have
difficulty if a force other than gravity was involved.
