![Item132_fig1.gif](../images/Item132_fig1.gif){: .image-with-caption } A
uniform volume distribution of charge has radius R and total charge Q. 
A point charge -q is released from rest at point b, which is a distance
3R from the center of the distribution. When the point charge reaches a,
which of the following is true regarding the total energy, E?

1.  E<sub>a</sub> = -E<sub>b</sub>
2. E<sub>a</sub> = -2E<sub>b</sub>/3
3. E<sub>a</sub> = -3E<sub>b</sub>/2
4. E<sub>a</sub> = -9E<sub>b</sub>/4
5. E<sub>a</sub> = E<sub>b</sub>
6. E<sub>a</sub> = 2E<sub>b</sub>/3
7. E<sub>a</sub> = 3E<sub>b</sub>/2
8. E<sub>a</sub> = 9E<sub>b</sub>/4
9. None of the above
10. Cannot be determined

###Answer 

(5) Students often forget to include the kinetic energy,
especially after a lot of discussion of potential energy. Many will
simply misinterpret the energy to mean potential energy. Teasing apart
these issues is important.
