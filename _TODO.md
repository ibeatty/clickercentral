# ClickerCentral Site To-Do List

## Hosting

* Modify DNS w/Dreamhost to point https://clickercentral.net to the GitHub Pages site, and redirect clickercentral.org to https://clickercentral.net.


## Functionality

* A few items have a "Related Items" section at the bottom of the teacher commentary, containing nothing other than "002" or etc. Make these more informative and linked.

    * Re-render the JSON so that related items go into the frontmatter.

    * Put logic into the template to detect this frontmatter and make a list of related items, with descriptions and links, as they are shown in the Library list.

* Implement a tagging system that creates a sub-library page for each keyword, listing all items having that keyword (and a disclaimer that not all items have been tagged).


## Aesthetics



## Content

* Add metadata (esp. Description) to items 264-305.
* Proof and copy-edit all items.
